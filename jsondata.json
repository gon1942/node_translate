Here's what the readme. Debian says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The upstream name for the Node.js interpreter command is \"node\".\n    In Debian the interpreter command has been changed to \"nodejs\".</p>\n  \n  <p>This was done to prevent a namespace collision: other commands use\n    the same name in their upstream, such as ax25-node from the \"node\"\n    package.</p>\n  \n  <p>Scripts calling Node.js as a shell command must be changed to instead\n    use the \"nodejs\" command.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, using nodejs mucks up installing packages using <code>npm</code>. Package installation fails with the following error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>sh: 1: node: not found\nnpm WARN This failure might be due to the use of legacy binary \"node\"\nnpm WARN For further explanations, please read /usr/share/doc/nodejs/README.Debian\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do I make npm understand that nodejs is already installed on the system but the interpreter name is different?</p>\n"#######################===========question==========question id is :7947030title is : "Nginx no-www to www and www to no-www"body is :"<p>I am using <a href=\"http://www.howtoforge.com/running-phpmyadmin-on-nginx-lemp-on-debian-squeeze-ubuntu-11.04\" rel=\"noreferrer\">nginx on Rackspace cloud following a tutorial</a> and having searched the net and so far can't get this sorted.</p>\n\n<p>I want www.mysite.com to go to mysite.com as normal in .htaccess for SEO and other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>My <strong>/etc/nginx/sites-available/www.example.com.vhost</strong> config:</p>\n\n<pre><code>server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name www.example.com example.com;\n       root /var/www/www.example.com/web;\n\n       if ($http_host != \"www.example.com\") {\n                 rewrite ^ http://example.com$request_uri permanent;\n       }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also tried</p>\n\n<pre><code>server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name example.com;\n       root /var/www/www.example.com/web;\n\n       if ($http_host != \"www.example.com\") {\n                 rewrite ^ http://example.com$request_uri permanent;\n       }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also tried.
